  # EDA on Hootel Booking Analysis

EDA project on Hotel Booking Analysis, which aims to investigate cancellations and suggest measures to reduce them and secure revenue. The project covers booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details such as when the booking was made, length of stay, and the number of adults and children. 

The project follows a standard EDA process, starting with data exploration and inspection. The data impurities are dealt with in the second step by handling null values and dropping irrelevant data from the dataset. The EDA is divided into three analyses: Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis, and Multivariate analysis. 

The project concludes that by analyzing hotel bookings data and understanding cancellation patterns, hotels can take steps to reduce cancellations and increase revenue. For instance, hotels can offer discounts or promotions to customers who book early or for longer stays. Additionally, hotels can provide incentives such as free parking or breakfast to customers who book directly with them instead of through third-party websites. 

In summary, this EDA project provides valuable insights into hotel bookings data and offers practical suggestions for hotels to improve their revenue by reducing cancellations.
